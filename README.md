Howdy, my name is Bob and i've been learning Python for about a year, and decided to do
this project for fun. 

If you see something janky or have a suggestion leave a comment. 

To run the program I use Anaconda 5.0 in visual studio. I recommend it because it should 
have all the packages and modules you need. I also have SQLite/SQL Server Compact Toolbox
isntalled.

When you run the debugger it will prompt you for an API key which you can get for free
from AlphaVantage.co.

The function to pull data down from the API iterates over a list of stock tickers. You
can add the stocks you would like to cover.

I just started working on this, but eventually I would like to add more data sources to the
Database, because just looking at share price changes is not enough to do rigorous analysis.

Once I have a richer dataset I would like to use some machine learning libraries to train
models, and run them. I'd also like to add some SQL reports down the road. A front end that
allows people to work with the data without running scripts would also be nice. 

Thanks for checking out the project.
